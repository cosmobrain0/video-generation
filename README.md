# Video Generation Library

This is a project inspired by [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io), a procedural, reactive framework for building video animations in TypeScript, which uses the web browser and is based on the HTML5 Canvas API as well as some CSS stuff.  
It's a pretty cool project, and it can be used to make some awesome stuff!

This is a procedural, reactive framework for building video animations. Right now, animations are written in Rust, but I'm considering adding a scripting language like Lua instead (Rust compile times are crazy).  

This is still a **work in progress**, and is **not** ready to be used professionally. If you would like to play around with it, you can have a look at `main.rs` in the main branch to see how you make an animation.
